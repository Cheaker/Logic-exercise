Q: There are 8 balls with same weight and one with deviating. You need to find out the deviating ball by least number of weighing attempts just having simple scale. Does it matter whether you know the deviating ball is heavier?

A: Download source files, compile main.java, run and find it out! ;)

Left click to add balls to the left side of scale, right click to the right side
